# HomeAutomation
21 days Embedded Training GUI Project

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Qt: Your system should have the Qt framework installed. You can download and install it from the official Qt website.

### Compiler:
QMake generates Makefiles that are used by a C++ compiler to build your project. Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed on your system.
On Windows, you can use the MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.
On macOS, the Xcode Command Line Tools provide the necessary compiler.
On Linux, GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is commonly used.

### Build Tools:
Make sure you have the build tools required by your operating system. On Linux and macOS, make is typically used. On Windows, you can use tools like MinGW's mingw32-make or Microsoft Visual Studio's nmake

## Dependencies
Qt 5.12: A version of the Qt framework that matches or exceeds Qt 5.12 is required.
qtbase: The Qt base module.
qtdeclarative: The Qt Declarative module.

## Installation
### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/segestic/HomeAutomation.git

### Navigate to the project directory
cd HomeAutomation

### Run the project (provide relevant commands)
qmake HomeAutomation.pro


N.B.: Assuming that the required prerequisites are installed and Qt is properly set up, the qmake utility will be automatically executed by Qt. All, you simply need to navigate to the "File" menu within Qt Creator and proceed to open the .pro file associated with your project. (Please refer to day 19 of this training program for installation guidelines.)
